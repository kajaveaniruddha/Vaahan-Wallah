Vaahan Wallah
		- A simulator for vehicle rental system


Vaahan Wallah is a system time based simulator. 
We have used ".txt" files as our data base.
Showcasing our OOP's knowledge was our priority thus,
This is a beautiful CLI project in Cpp. In due course of project
we have learnt many techniques to design and animate terminal, various concepts 
related to OOP and their implementation and the most important team work in building
a project. With respect to future aspects we have added 3 types of vehicles: 
cars, buses and bikes in our simulator
to show that our program has enough potential to accomodate more types
of vehicles in upcoming time.
